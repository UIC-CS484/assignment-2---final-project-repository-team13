# TESTING STRATEDGY:
```
We will write tests after each feature we implement, to make sure that it is a functional feature, before moving on to other features. Testing code in smaller chunks is easier than testing the entire project at the end. It is easier to spot and fix a bug when your working with a smaller part of a program. Another reason we will be testing each feature as soon as we finish implementing it, is so that we can make sure that other features that are built on top of it are easier to debug. If one feature builds off of another feature and the first feature has some sort of bug, it just adds to the complexitity of trying to find the bug. The code is larger and more interconnected, making it harder to debug. We will also be automating our testing process. The first test we made in this assignment (In Endpoint.test.js) checks to see if a new user can create an account successfully and the second test checks to see if this new user can then login successfully after creating an account.
